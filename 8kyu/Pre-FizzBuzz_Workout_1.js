/*This is the first step to understanding FizzBuzz.

Your inputs: a positive integer, n, greater than or equal to one. n is provided, you have NO CONTROL over its value.

Your expected output is an array of positive integers from 1 to n (inclusive).

Your job is to write an algorithm that gets you from the input to the output.
